    <P>Media Queries defines a syntax for short expressions that describe required features of media (or devices), e.g.: minimum or maximum screen size, color capabilities, resolution, aspect ratio, type of pointing device, viewing environment, scripting capabilities, etc. Media Queries is related to the work on CC/PP, but is a more light-weight and limited solution.
        Such expressions can be attached as labels to style sheets or other resources, to indicate what media they are designed for. They are used, e.g., in HTML (in the media attribute).</P>
    <p>CSS uses them on '@import' and '@media' and they occur in similar ways in SVG and generic XML.
        Media Queries level 4 is an extended version of the first Media Queries. It adds a handful of new media features, such as 'pointer' and 'hover' (for capabilities of the pointing device) and 'block-overflow' (for paged vs scrolling media), which provide more precise information about the media than the old 'handheld' vs 'screen' and 'projection' vs 'screen' distinctions.
